- 👋 Hi, I’m @spedrott

- 👀 I’m interested in improving the performance and lowering the cost of critical space technologies, like vision-based navigation, in-space inspection, and precision landing and hazard avoidance.

- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on any of the above!

- 📫 Feel free to drop me a line-- samuel.m.pedrotty@nasa.gov
